You are also free to create an instance of AndHUD and use it yourself!  \n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n```csharp\n//Show a simple status message with an indeterminate spinner and a Clear background\nAndHUD.Shared.Show(myActivity, \"Status Message\", MaskType.Clear);\n\n//Show a progress with a filling circle representing the progress amount, showing 60% full\nAndHUD.Shared.ShowProgress(myActivity, \"Loading… 60%\", 60);\n\n//Show a success image with a message, with a Clear background, and auto-dismiss after 2 seconds\nAndHUD.Shared.ShowSuccess(myActivity, \"It Worked!\", MaskType.Clear, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));\n\n//Show an error image with a message with a Dimmed background, and auto-dismiss after 2 seconds\nAndHUD.Shared.ShowError(myActivity, \"It no worked :(\", MaskType.Black, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));\n\n//Show a toast, similar to Android toasts, but styled as AndHUD, with a clear background, auto-dismiss after 2 seconds\nAndHUD.Shared.ShowToast(myActivity, \"This is a non-centered Toast…\", MaskType.Clear, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));\n\n//Show a custom image with text\nAndHUD.Shared.ShowImage(myActivity, Resource.Drawable.MyCustomImage, \"Custom\");\n\n//Dismiss a HUD that will or will not be automatically timed out\nAndHUD.Shared.Dismiss(myActivity);\n\n//Show a HUD and only close it when it\u0027s clicked\nAndHUD.Shared.ShowToast(this, \"Click this toast to close it!\", MaskType.Clear, null, true, () =\u003e AndHUD.Shared.Dismiss(this));\n```\n\nOther Options\n-------------\n - **MaskType:** By default, MaskType.Black dims the background behind the HUD.  Use MaskType.Clear to prevent the dimming\n - **Timeout:** If you provide a timeout, the HUD will automatically be dismissed after the timeout elapses, if you have not already dismissed it manually.\n - **Click Callback:** If you provide a clickCallback parameter, when the HUD is tapped by the user, the action supplied will be executed.\n\n","Hash":"5e7a58cf4b86b2ca12b90b489da222a3","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
